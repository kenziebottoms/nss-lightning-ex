1. Make an object with at least three properties. One property should be a method.
1. Create a new object that links to the first object.
1. Give the new object two properties of its own.
1. In the console, call `.hasOwnProperty()` on the new object, passing in an inherited property as an argument. Does it return `true` or `false`?
1. Do it again, but this time pass in one of the properties you added to the new object. `true` or `false`?
